            <h3>Last week north campus explorers finally discovered the elusive south campus. Although once thought to be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado">El Dorado</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis">Atlantis</a> the once believed mythical location has been shown to be real.</h3>

            <p>On September 8th, 2021 an expedition of north campus explorers found the lost campus at Umass Lowell. Before recently we thought that UML only possessed 2 active campus however the once thought mythical
                south campus was proven to be real. As many may already know Umass Lowell once posessed a west campus a region of campus that we have already discovered the ruins of. Until this discovery the best
                scientist of north campus beleved that south must have suffered the same fate or did not exist at all. We at the Riverhawk Tribune asked once south campus skeptic Gregory Kaplowitz what he thought of 
                the recent discovery.

                <p>"I certainly never thought this day would come but it appears to be true.  Now I'll be 
                    the first to admit that I was always one of the most vocal in the scientific community
                    about how this was no more than fantasy and legend but in the face of indisputable proof
                    I'll also be the first to admit that I am wrong.  While many are taking time just to marval 
                    in the new discovery it is important to think about our next move.  This land does appear to 
                    be inhabited and we donâ€™t know what we might find there.  I have talked with my fellow colleagues 
                    and we agree that the first course of action is the send out a preliminary scouting party to 
                    learn what we can but until then we can only imagine what types of new and mysterious things 
                    we might find out there"</p>
            </div>
            <p>The local inhabitants appear to study what they call liberal arts and construct half indoor, half outdoor
                structures call gazebos. We will continue to study and observe this new and distinct culture from our own.
                Our explorers have dicovered the following structures that have been constructed by the south campus native population
